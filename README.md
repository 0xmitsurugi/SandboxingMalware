A malware sandoxed with gdb

I analyzed an ELF malware sample and I finished by writing a small
gdb script which blocks all dangerous function.

The Rx64 file is zipped with the well-known password of infected files.

The blogspot here: http://0x90909090.blogspot.fr/2016/06/sandboxing-linux-malware-with-gdb.html
explains the method and how this works.
